# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Catch compounding AI errors at the plan boundary — before they become the foundation for the next plan.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Extension Scaffold + GSD Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Extension Scaffold + GSD Integration)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Project initialized, research complete, roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: -

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key architectural decisions from project initialization:

- **Init**: Hook point confirmed — `review_team_gate` step between `update_codebase_map` and `offer_next` in execute-plan.md
- **Init**: No gsd-tools.cjs modification needed — `workflow.review_team` readable via `jq` on existing `config_content`
- **Init**: Sanitizer is the real isolation gate — Task() isolation is automatic, but the only contamination vector is the orchestrator passing executor content into reviewer prompts
- **Init**: Routing is deterministic in workflow code — `critical → block_and_escalate` is hardcoded minimum, not a synthesizer judgment call
- **Init**: Synthesizer prohibited from generating new findings — every finding must trace to a reviewer source
- **Init**: Pattern-based patch insertion anchored on `<step name="offer_next">` — safe across GSD version updates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Open**: Does AI merge in `reapply-patches` handle XML `<step>` blocks reliably across GSD version changes? (Test during Phase 1)
- **Open**: Sanitized ARTIFACT.md written to disk vs. passed inline — product decision for Phase 2
- **Open**: REVIEW-REPORT.md per-phase vs. global — product decision for Phase 4
